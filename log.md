## Vocab

Sampled about 1556480 blocks in region (0, 0, 0) and (-2000, 80, 64), with skipping on x and z directions but not z direction. Vocab are formed by unique blocks and tags with equivalent block and tags considered.

In the sampling, skipped some chunk sections of mostly air as the bug in the library prevent reading them.

Vocab size is 70
